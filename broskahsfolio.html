            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate from Davis & Elkins College, and I was in the National Honor Soceity during my time
                there. When I became a Senior
                I took on a leadership position within the Society, I was the Secretary of the Treasury. I maintained at
                least a 3.0 GPA throughout my college career,
                and was on the Dean's or President's list every year. For my capstone project, I used a mix of software
                and hardware to complete a final capstone,
                which is talked about further in Link 1. Since graduating college I have been working as a repair tech
                in an electronics repair shop.
                I find enjoyment in the job as I love to be aroud computers, but at heart I am an aspiring programmer.
                I've built a couple websites from scratch or with the help
                of websites like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>, as well as written a few programs,
                such as flash games. I've dabbled in database structures such as SQL or Mongo,
                but I'm ultimately looking to become a web developer or a python programmer. Please reach out to me at
                (304) 943-9052 regarding a job offer today! Thank you!!
